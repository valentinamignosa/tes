# TES — Tracing Eastern Sicily’s Networks (9th–6th centuries BCE) 

## Project Overview

**TES** (www.unive.it/tes) investigates the political, social, and economic dynamics shaping **southeastern Sicily** between the **10th and 6th centuries BCE**, a period preceding and accompanying processes traditionally associated with Greek colonization. 

Rather than analysing sites in isolation, the project approaches the region as an **interconnected landscape**, structured by mobility corridors, environmental constraints, and shared cultural practices.

TES explores how communities interacted within regional systems of exchange, production, and communication, combining archaeological, historical, and epigraphic evidence.

## Study Area

The research concentrates on the **Hyblean and southeastern Sicilian region**, defined through environmental connectivity rather than political borders.

River valleys, upland plateaus, and coastal corridors are treated as structuring elements shaping:

- settlement distribution  
- movement routes  
- access to raw materials  
- cultural interaction zones

Geographical limits are therefore analytical tools rather than fixed historical boundaries.

## Chronological Framework

TES adopts a **high-resolution chronological model** organised in **25-year intervals (1000–500 BCE)**.

This allows comparison across sites without forcing rigid archaeological periodization and preserves chronological uncertainty as part of historical interpretation.

---

## Data Model

The project database is structured around analytical domains representing observable social practices:

- **Resources** — stone, clay, metals, water systems  
- **Production** — workshops, technologies, craft activity  
- **Storage & circulation** — distribution and economic flows  
- **Cult places** — ritual landscapes and shared practices  
- **Funerary evidence** — markers of social differentiation  
- **Figurative culture** — visual communication and identity  
- **Epigraphy** — writing practices as social action

These categories function as **network indicators**, allowing relationships between sites to emerge from aggregated evidence.

## Digital Workflow

TES develops its datasets through a collaborative Digital Humanities workflow.

Data creation and editorial management are carried out using **Cadmus**, the scholarly data framework developed by **Daniele Fusi**, which enables:

- structured scholarly editing  
- controlled vocabularies  
- explicit recording of uncertainty  
- interoperability with external infrastructures

The dataset is designed to integrate with:

- GIS environments  
- spatial network analysis  
- OpenAtlas-compatible infrastructures  
- FAIR and Linked Open Data principles

---

## Current Development

The project is actively building:

- a structured regional research database  
- interoperable archaeological and epigraphic datasets  
- workflows linking field observation, archival research, and digital modelling

The TES editor and API exposed through this infrastructure represent the **working research environment** rather than a finished publication platform.

## Collaboration

TES operates as an **open research environment** and welcomes scholarly exchange with projects addressing ancient connectivity, landscape archaeology, epigraphy, and digital infrastructures.

Ongoing intellectual exchanges connect TES with several international research initiatives and ERC projects working on Mediterranean networks and material culture.
